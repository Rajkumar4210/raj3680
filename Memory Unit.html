<p>The memory unit is a component of a computer system. It is used to store data, instructions and information. It is also known as a principal/primary/internal memory. There are two types of memory: –<br>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read-only memory (ROM)</strong>:- ROM is a part of the memory unit. This is read only memory, and it can not be used to write.<br>
<li><strong>Random-access memory (RAM)</strong>:- RAM is also part of the memory unit, and it is used for the temporary storage of program data.
When other computer units require information, this unit provides it. Internal storage unit, main memory, primary storage, and Random Access Memory are used to describe it (RAM). Its size has an impact on its speed, power, and capabilities. In a computer, there are two sorts of memories: primary memory and secondary memory.</li></ol><br>

<strong>The memory unit’s functions</strong><br>
<ul><li>It holds all of the necessary data and instructions for processing.
<li>It keeps track of the processing’s interim results.
<li>Before the final results of processing are sent to an output device, it saves them.
<li>The main memory receives and transmits all inputs and outputs.</li></p>
